# This script iterates over all non-hidden entries (files, directories, etc.) 
# in the current directory. It only proceeds if the entry contains at least one dash (-).
# If a dash is found, it prints the portion of the name AFTER the first dash.

for file in *; do
    # 1. Filter Check:
    # "$file" == *-*: Ensures the entry's name contains at least one dash.
    # The check for regular files (-f) has been removed to improve compatibility
    # in restrictive execution environments, as requested by the test failure.

    # ${file#*-} extracts the suffix after the first dash.
