# This script iterates over all non-hidden entries in the current directory.
# It uses a case statement to reliably check if the name contains a dash,
# and prints the portion of the name AFTER the first dash.

for file in *; do
    case "$file" in
        # Pattern: Matches any string that contains at least one dash
        *-*) 
            # If matched, remove the prefix up to the first dash and print.
            printf '%s\n' "${file#*-}"
            ;;
        # Default: If no dash is found, do nothing (continue)
        *)
